# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here
This project is an inventory management system that allows you to add/read/delete/update items and order as well as get the total order value of a particular order
it includes and requires a database that is required using MYSQL.
This project was handed as a template and working upon it by creating additional features that meet the specification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

THIS COULD BE BROKEN
I have had problems with merging where my tests dissapeared into limbo and could not merge from dev. during the mergin a whole bunch of new files appeared from nowhere so im not sure if it will work as I intended it to. So if it doesnt work the recording showcases it in action.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
Version Control System - Git
Source Code Management - GitHub
Kanban Board - Jira
Database - MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or cloud hosted)
Back-end Programming Language - Java
Build Tool - Maven
Unit Testing - JUnit




### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

git clone https://github.com/Omar-OAT/ims-project-template.git
```

java -jar ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

This will allow you to install the the application without cloning the repo.
>>>>>>> dev

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests


To run tests you just need to type 

mvn test

this will run the Junit tests and will output the tests and display the tests that have passed and failed

### Unit Tests 

These tests are for the DAO,Controller and domain classes and check to see if the output is what is expected
this allows for us to see what methods are not working an example of what a test may look like.

Unfortunately during mergin but after the presentation I seem to have lost all of my test files. I showed on the recording that I did have them included
along with coverage. as the deadline is coming towards me I find that Ill just have to upload my project as it is. I am greatly dissapointed and discouraged that his happened.




### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
